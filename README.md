<h1> Hello! ðŸ‘‹ </h1> 
My name is JoÃ£o Victor Ramponi Zanon, I'm 16 years old, and I'm a student at ETEC de Registro. I've been fascinated by technology since I was a child, and I'm now on the path to becoming a developer.

Currently, I'm taking an English course to enhance my communication skills, especially in the global programming environment. My favorite programming language is C#, and I'm always looking for new projects and challenges to improve my skills.

Welcome to my profile! Here, you'll find some of my projects and contributions. I'm excited to share my progress and learn from the amazing developer community here on GitHub.
